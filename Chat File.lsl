//Adding this file so we can leave eachother messages when necessary.

If you ask me I think we've gone too far ahead of ourselves.  Maybe we should roll it 
back and test the HUD with one item of functionality at a time?  Also, maybe we shouldn't
go any furthur until we have this outline down pat?  Of course we should definately test
your idea to fix the current sound bug first.
